This is a story about who i am.

I am currently a university student who's aspiring to become a fullstack developer at a huge company that will pay me lots.
These months, I've been learning many things about what a fullstack developer does.
And my plan for next year, is to make sure that I've learned the basics and start making projects for my portofolio.
And by the time I'm 24 years old, I must be able to work abroad.
